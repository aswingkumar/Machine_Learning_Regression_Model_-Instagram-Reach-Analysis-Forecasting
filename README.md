# Machine_Learning__-Instagram-Reach-Analysis_and_Forecasting_ Using Both Regression And Classification models To Predict Best One

In this case study on Instagram Reach Analysis and Forecasting, we analyzed a dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing various engagement metrics such as likes, comments, shares, and impressions. The objective was to predict Instagram reach using both regression and classification models, helping content creators and businesses optimize their social media strategies.

For the regression task, we employed Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting models to predict reach as a continuous variable. For classification, we categorized reach into different levels and trained models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting to classify posts based on their expected reach. Among these, XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 83.56%, followed by the Decision Tree model with 76.71% accuracy.

The results indicate that engagement features significantly influence reach, and machine learning models can effectively forecast trends. While the models performed well, further improvements such as hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and deep learning approaches could enhance accuracy. Additionally, incorporating real-time data and social media trends would refine predictions. Overall, this study demonstrates how predictive analytics can provide valuable insights, empowering businesses and influencers to strategically enhance their Instagram presence and maximize audience engagement.
